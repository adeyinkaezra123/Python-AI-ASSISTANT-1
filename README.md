# Python-AI-ASSISTANT-1
I always thought that if I could have my own A.I. just like Jarvis, you all must have thought the same.
Have you ever wondered how cool it would be to have your own A.I. assistant? Imagine how easier it would be to send emails without typing a single word, searching on wikipedia without actually opening the web browsers, and performing many other daily tasks with the help of a single voice command.
In this tutorial, you are gonna learn how to code and build your own A.I. voice assistant in Python.
What can this A.I. assistant do for YOU?
It can send emails for you.
It can play music for you.
It can do Wikipedia searches for you.
It can open websites like Google, Youtube, etc., in a web browser.
It can open your code editor or IDE with a single voice command.

The implemented voice assistant can perform the following task it can open YouTube, Gmail, Google chrome and stack overflow. Predict current time, take a photo, search Wikipedia to abstract required data, predict weather in different cities, get top headline news from Times of India and can answer computational and geographical questions too.
Enough talk! Letâ€™s start building our very own A.I assistant.
